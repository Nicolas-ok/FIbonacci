Fibonacci Sequence

This algorithm shows how to calculate the Fibonacci series in Java.

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers such that each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with 0 and 1. The beginning of the sequence is this 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...

The elements of this sequence are called Fibonacci's children. This sequence was described by Leonardo of Pisa, an Italian mathematician of the 13th century also known as Fibonacci. It has numerous applications in computer science, mathematics and game theory. It also appears in biological configurations, such as in the branches of trees, in the arrangement of leaves on the stem, in the flowers of artichokes and sunflowers, in the inflorescences of Romanesco broccoli, in the configuration of conifer cones, in the reproduction of rabbits, and in how DNA encodes the growth of complex organic forms. It is also found in the spiral shell structure of some mollusks, such as the nautilus.

Use the BigInteger type for calculations.
